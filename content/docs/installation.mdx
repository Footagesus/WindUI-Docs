A Tutorial on how to install WindUI Source on your device and edit it. 

<Steps>

<Step>
### Clone Repository
Clone the [WindUI](https://github.com/Footagesus/WindUI/) repository from GitHub to your local machine.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Footagesus/WindUI.git
```
This command will create a copy of the WindUI project in your working directory, allowing you to modify and customize it as needed.
</Step>

<Step>
### Install Dependencies
Navigate to the cloned directory and install npm packages:
You need [aftman](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/aftman) to install darklua
```bash
cd WindUI

npm install
aftman install
```


</Step>

<Step>
### Build WindUI
Once everything is set up, you can build WindUI:

- For development, run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

- For production build, run:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

- For development live-build, run:
    ```bash
    npm run live-build
    ```
    
    This will start a local build server at http://localhost:8642.
    It automatically build your changes and serves a ready-to-use development bundle, so you can instantly test it in Roblox without manual rebuilding.
    
    Usage in Roblox (exploit environment):
    ```luau
    loadstring(game:HttpGet("http://localhost:8642/dist/main.lua"))()
    ```
