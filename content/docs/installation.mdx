<Steps>

<Step>
### Clone Repository
First, clone the [WindUI](https://github.com/Footagesus/WindUI/) repository from GitHub to your local machine.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Footagesus/WindUI.git
```
This command will create a copy of the WindUI project in your working directory, allowing you to modify and customize it as needed.
</Step>

<Step>
### Install Required Tools
Make sure you have:
- Node Package Manager (npm)
- Lua
- [darklua](https://darklua.com/)

</Step>

<Step>
### Bundle WindUI
Once everything is set up, you can bundle WindUI:

- For development, run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

- For production build, run:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

- For development live-build, run:
    ```bash
    npm run live-build
    ```
    
    This will start a local build server at http://localhost:8642.
    It automatically build your changes and serves a ready-to-use development bundle, so you can instantly test it in Roblox without manual rebuilding.
    
    Example usage in Roblox:
    ```luau
    loadstring(game:HttpGet("http://localhost:8642/dist/main.lua"))()
    ```
